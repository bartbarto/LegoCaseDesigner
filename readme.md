Lego Case Designer
===============

For christmas, I got a Lego iPhone case upon which you could build with lego.
I had a hard time coming up with a design for it, so I made this.

You can upload an image, which will be reduced to a 7x15 (Lego size of the case) image, or you can draw your own case design.

Requires a modern browser (Painting is blurry in Chrome).
